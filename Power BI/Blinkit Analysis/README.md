<h2>📈 Key Insights</h2>
<h4>Overall Sales Trend (2019-2022)</h4>
Total sales over time reveal significant month-to-month volatility, with no strong long-term upward or downward trend. Peaks occur irregularly across years, indicating that demand is influenced more by seasonal factors, specific promotions, or customer order cycles rather than consistent growth patterns. <br />
•	Arabica and Robusta exhibit the most pronounced spikes, suggesting they are key volume drivers.<br />
•	Excelsa and Liberica show moderate but fluctuating sales patterns, reflecting niche or specialty customer demand.<br />
<h4>Geographical Performance</h4>
Sales distribution across countries shows clear market concentration:
•	The United States is the dominant revenue contributor with $2,493, far outpacing other regions.<br />
•	Ireland follows with $537, and
•	The United Kingdom trails with $278.<br />
This indicates strong penetration in the U.S. market, while the European markets show potential for growth with targeted marketing and channel expansion.
<h4>Customer Insights</h4>
The dashboard highlights the Top 5 Customers, who collectively form a significant chunk of recurring sales:
•	The highest-spending customer contributes $43, followed closely by others spending between $30 and $36.<br />
These moderate but consistent purchase levels suggest a broad customer base with relatively even ordering patterns, rather than a heavy reliance on a few high-value buyers. This reduces revenue risk but also indicates an opportunity to nurture loyalty programs or bulk-order incentives.
<h4>Product Characteristics & Segmentation</h4>
Filters for Roast **Type, Size, and Loyalty** indicate that sales analysis can be refined by customer preferences. 
•	Roast Type (Dark, Light, Medium) allows analysis of flavor preferences.<br />
•	Size variations (0.2kg to 2.5kg) suggest diverse buyer needs, from personal use to commercial consumption.<br />
•	Loyalty segmentation (Yes/No) supports retention analysis and effectiveness of loyalty initiatives.<br />
<h2>Strategic Implications</h2>
The analysis insights support several strategic directions:<br />
•	Market Expansion: Significant reliance on U.S. customers highlights an opportunity to strengthen outreach in Ireland, the U.K., and other regions.<br />
•	Product Optimization: Given varying trends among coffee types, marketing efforts could focus on promoting consistently high-performing varieties (Arabica & Robusta) while repositioning weaker sellers.<br />
•	Customer Engagement: Top customers exhibit moderate spend levels, indicating room for growth through loyalty rewards, upselling larger sizes, or subscription models.<br />
•	Seasonal Planning: The irregular monthly sales patterns suggest a need to investigate underlying causes (e.g., seasonality, promotions) to better forecast and stabilize revenue.<br />
