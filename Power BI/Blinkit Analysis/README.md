<h2>📈 Key Insights</h2>
<h4>Overall Business Performance</h4>
•	Total Sales: $1.20M, indicating healthy overall revenue generation<br />
•	Average Sales per Item: $141, suggesting consistent transaction value across products<br />
•	Total Items Sold: 8,523, reflecting high product movement and customer demand<br />
•	Average Customer Rating: 3.97, showing generally positive customer satisfaction, though with room for service or product experience improvement<br />
<h4>Sales Trend & Outlet Establishment</h4>
•	Sales show steady growth from 2011 through 2018, peaking at approximately $0.20M in 2018, indicating successful outlet expansion and market penetration<br />
•	A decline post-2018 suggests possible market saturation, external disruptions, or operational challenges<br />
•	Stabilization by 2022 around $0.13M reflects recovery and sustained demand despite prior downturns<br />
Outlet expansion has historically driven revenue growth, but future gains may depend more on efficiency and optimization than new outlet openings.
<h4>Product & Category Performance</h4>
<h6>Top-performing categories:</h6>
•	Fruits & Vegetables – $0.18M
•	Snack Foods – $0.18M
•	Household items – $0.14M
<h6>Lower-performing categories:</h6> 
Seafood, Breakfast items, and Others contribute minimally<br />
Daily-consumption essentials dominate revenue, reinforcing Blinkit’s positioning as a convenience-first, quick-commerce platform.
<h4>Fat Content Analysis</h4>
Filters for Roast **Type, Size, and Loyalty** indicate that sales analysis can be refined by customer preferences. 
•	Regular-fat products contribute ~$776K, while low-fat products contribute ~$425K<br />
•	Across all outlet tiers, regular-fat products consistently outperform low-fat options<br />
Despite growing health awareness, customer purchasing behavior still favors regular variants, presenting an opportunity for targeted health-product promotions rather than broad expansion.
<h4>Outlet Size Performance</h4>
•	Medium-sized outlets lead sales with approximately $507.9K, followed by: Small outlets: $444.8K, High-sized outlets: $248.9K<br />
Medium outlets strike the best balance between assortment depth and operational efficiency, making them the most profitable format.
<h4>Outlet Location & Tier Analysis</h4>
•	Tier 3 locations outperform Tier 1 and Tier 2, generating $472.1K in sales<br />
•	Tier 2 follows with $393.2K, while Tier 1 contributes $336.4K<br />
Emerging and semi-urban markets show stronger demand growth, potentially due to lower competition and increasing adoption of quick-commerce services.
<h4>Outlet Type Performance</h4>
•	Supermarket Type 1 dominates, contributing $787.6K in total sales and 5,577 items sold, making it the backbone of Blinkit’s revenue<br />
•	Grocery Stores and other supermarket formats contribute significantly less but maintain comparable average sales and ratings<br />
<h2>Strategic Implications</h2>
•  Revenue concentration in Supermarket Type 1 and medium-sized outlets suggests clear priorities for investment and optimization<br />
•  Tier 3 markets present the strongest growth opportunity, warranting focused expansion and localized marketing<br />
•  Core essentials drive sales, reinforcing the need to maintain supply chain reliability for high-demand categories<br />
•  Customer satisfaction is stable, but incremental improvements could lift ratings above 4.0 and improve loyalty<br />
•  Future growth should prioritize efficiency, assortment optimization, and visibility improvements over aggressive physical expansion<br />
